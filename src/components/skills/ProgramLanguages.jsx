                            Oftentimes software engineers put all the languages they "know" on their website. At this point I have
                            worked with more languages than I can count, and personally I do not know what people mean when they say they "know" a language. There's a more in-depth list on my resume, but I have worked with most of 
                            big languages, such as Python, C / C++, Java / C#, SQL, JavaScript, etc. What I am trying to say is, I am willing and able to learn
                            whatever languages that are required for the project.
