        I enjoy learning in general. I spent some time with piano, self-studying and performing in recitals, and now am slowly working on guitar. I used to do violin back in the day as well. Languages also interest me. My family is part Japanese, so I began\
        language learning with Japanese and intend to move onto either German or Mandarin in the near future. With regards to Japanese, I enjoy Manzai (SandwichMan in particular). Long walks on the beach are also a good time.\
